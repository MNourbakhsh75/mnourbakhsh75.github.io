								<h3>Undergraduate Researcher at University Of Tehran — Summer and Fall 2020</h3>
								<p>• The objective of this project was to employ the Model-Based Design concept for the design and simulation of an embedded system in Simulink,
as well as to oversee the entire system lifecycle. Several techniques were employed for designing and testing distinct components of the
embedded system, including the controller. The system underwent various testing phases, including Hardware in Loop, Software in Loop,
and Model in Loop evaluations. Multiple systems were designed and tested in a real-world context using Simulink Real-Time and Simulink 3D
Animation, facilitating the creation of complete virtual environments. <br/> • Under supervision of Dr. Mehdi Kargahi.

									<h4>Emotion Recognition of Speech</h4>
									<p>• Emotion recognition from sounds using a variety of machine learning techniques was undertaken. A dataset containing sounds depicting
various emotions, such as Anger, Disgust, and Sadness, was assembled. From the data, diverse features like Chroma, Constant Q-transform,
and Zero Crossing Rate were extracted.
										<br/> • These features were subjected to different classification techniques such as KNN, SVM, and MLP for emotion classification. Furthermore, various
clustering methods, including K-Means, DBSCAN, and K-Medoids, were applied to the data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of its
underlying structure.</p>

									<h4>BERT Implementation From Scratch &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/MNourbakhsh75/NN_CA5" style="position: static;" class="icon brands fa-github-square fa-lg"></a></h4>
									<p>• The implementation of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) was carried out. To attain a deeper comprehension
of their core functionality, all components of a Transformer, including the encoder, decoder, and multihead attention mechanisms, were constructed from the ground up. Additionally, Segment Embeddings, Token Embeddings, and Position Embeddings were developed as part of the
implementation process. Moreover, an Attention Visualizer was created using the bertviz library.

									<h4>GAN Implementation &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/MNourbakhsh75/NN_CA6" style="position: static;" class="icon brands fa-github-square fa-lg"></a></h4>
									<p>• This assignment involved the implementation of various Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Specifically, a Deep Convolutional GAN was
built from the ground up, and various techniques were employed to enhance its training process. These techniques included One-sided label
smoothing, batch normalization, and the addition of noise. Furthermore, a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) was implemented, incorporating different
loss functions aimed at enhancing the overall performance of the GAN.

									<h4>Working with Testnet Network</h4>
									<p>• The project’s objective was to acquire insight into the mechanics of Bitcoin. It involved generating a valid address for the testnet network utilizing SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hash functions. Additionally, through the utilization of python-bitcoinlib, various transactions were created and
disseminated within the testnet network. Furthermore, the project encompassed the simulation and testing of the complete mining process
using an actual block from the Bitcoin mainnet network.

									<h4>Job offer System &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/MNourbakhsh75/IE_CA" style="position: static;" class="icon brands fa-github-square fa-lg"></a></h4> 
									<p>• The project involved creating a web application similar to <a href="https://jooble.org/">Jooble</a> for job offers. The project encompassed various phases. The first phase
entailed designing and implementing the program logic and backend using Java and the Spring framework. The second phase involved crafting
the frontend design using React. Additionally, a database for data storage with JPA was designed, and finally, security mechanisms such as JWT,
Docker, and Kubernetes were implemented.
